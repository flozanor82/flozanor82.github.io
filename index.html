		My research interests lie in the intersection between public finance and social policy. I focus on taxation and behavior and on revenue-generating social-policies 
		that provide different levels of governments with fiscal independence while at the same time attaining social goals. My specific interests include consumption taxation 
		effects on local government finances, taxation of sugar-sweetened beverage, sales tax holidays, higher education financial aid and more recently policy responses to 
		the opioid epidemic and to the COVID-19 epidemic. My research has been published in journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 
		Demography and Health Economics, and it has been portrayed by media outlets such as US News & World Report, the Wall Street Journal, Tax Foundation, and NPR.

		Assistant Professor of Public Budgeting and Finance</a> in the Fall of 2020.  I received my PhD in Public Affairs from Indiana University's O'Neill School in the

		in matters related to student financial aid, and I was the Chief Planning Officer (2014) for ICETEX, the student loan agency in my home country, Colombia.</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;">In my dissertation, driven by an interest in inequality, I study how implementation and design of social policies result in differences from the ideal theoretical outcomes.
		<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3225901">In my job market paper</a>, first, I intend to answer if there are differences in the decrease of consumption caused by the policy when we compare
		the liquid consumption to the sugar intake from sugary drinks. As the tax is levied at the liquid level it opens a margin of substitution for consumers to avoid the tax,
		consume drinks with a higher sugar concentration. Furthermore, I intend to answer if there are different responses across subpopulations, as 
		not all consumers have the same health problems derived by sugary drink consumption. The article uses Scancode data, and data derived from a python self developed
		webscrapping procedure across online stores. I find that the decrease in sugar intake is approximately 25% lower relative to the overall change in consumption, and that 
		there is not a substantial difference in the behavioral response of the subgroups I analyze. </p>
	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;"> In the other essays, I intend to answer how to deal with the unintended unaffordability of 
		traditional <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3208286" style="color: blue">student loans</a> by means of combining them with small cash subsidies in Colombia, and also
		revisit the unsettled question of incidence during <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2986456" style="color: blue">back-to-school sales tax holidays</a>.
