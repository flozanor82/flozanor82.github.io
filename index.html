	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;"> My research interests span from applied micro into social policies, to their public finance consequences. I use the tools of data 
		science and causal inference to research questions I set myself to answer. I hold concentrations in Public Finance and Policy Analysis from SPEA and a minor in Data Sceince from the School of Informatics. 
		Previously I majored in Finance during my masters in Taiwan, China, and in Economics during my bachelor's.</p>
	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;"> Professors 
		<a href="https://https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/pirog-maureen.html">Maureen Pirog</a>
		and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jross08/">Justin Ross</a> 
		chair my Dissertation Committee at SPEA and I have received an immense contribution and influence from them. I have also been advised and encouraged by the other members of my Committee, Professors 
		<a href="https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/simon-kosali.html</p>">Kosali Simon</a>
		and <a href="https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/heim-bradley.html">Bradley Heim</a>.
	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;">In my dissertation, driven by an inerest in inequality, I study how implementation and design of social policies result on differences with respect to the ideal theoretical outcomes.
		<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3225901">In my job market paper</a>, first, I intend to answer if there are differences in the decrease of consumption caused by the policy when we compare
		the liquid consumption to the sugar intake from sugary drinks. As the tax is levied at the liquid level it opens a margin of substitution for consumers to avoid the tax,
		consume drinks with a higher sugar concentration. Furthermore, I intend to answer if there are different responses across subpopulations, as 
		not all consumers have the same health problems derived by sugary drink consumption. The article uses Scancode data, and data derived from a python self developed
		webscrapping procedure across online stores. I find that the decrease in sugar intake is approximately 25% lower relative to the overall change in consumption, and that 
		there is not a substantial difference in the behavioral response of the subgroups I analyze. </p>
	<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;"> In the other essays, I intend to answer how to deal with the unintended unaffordability of 
		traditional <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3208286">student loans</a> by means of combining them with small cash subsidies in Colombia, and also
		revisit the unsettled question of incidence during <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2986456">back-to-school sales tax holidays</a>.
