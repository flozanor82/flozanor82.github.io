<p style="color:black;font-size:12px;">I am a Ph.D.(c) in Public Affairs at Indiana University. My research interests span from applied microeconomics
	to social policies, to their public finance consequences. I use the tools of data science and causal inference
	to answer the research questions I set myself to answer. I hold concentrations in Public Finance and Policy Analysis. </p>
<p>In my dissertation, driven by an inerest in inequality, I study how implementation and design of social policies result on differences with respect to the ideal theoretical outcomes.
	In my job market paper, first, I intend to answer if there are differences in the decrease of consumption casued by the policy when we compare
	the liquid consumption to the sugar intake from sugary drinks. As the tax levied at the liquid level it opens a margin of substitution for consumers to avoid the tax,
	consume drinks with a higher sugar concentration. Furthermore, I intend to answer if there are different responses from different subpopulations, as 
	not all consumers have the same health problems derived by sugary drink consumption. The article uses Scancode data, and data derived from a python self developed
	webscrapping procedure across online stores. I find that the decrease in sugar intake is approximately 25% lower relative to the overall change in consumption, and that 
	there is not a substantial difference in the behavioral response of the subgroups I analize. </p>
<p> In the other essays, I intend to answer how to deal with the unintended unaffordability of traditional sutdent loans by means of combining them with smll cash subsidies in Colombia, and also
	revisit the unsettled question of incidence during back-to-school sales tax holidays.</p>
